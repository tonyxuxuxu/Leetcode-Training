"""
Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.

Recover the tree without changing its structure.

Example 1:

Input: [1,3,null,null,2]

   1
  /
 3
  \
   2

Output: [3,1,null,null,2]

   3
  /
 1
  \
   2
Example 2:

Input: [3,1,4,null,null,2]

  3
 / \
1   4
   /
  2

Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]

  2
 / \
1   4
   /
  3
Follow up:

A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward.
Could you devise a constant space solution?
